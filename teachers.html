      <h1>Pat Brown</h1><img id="treehouse" src="img/teacher5.jpg" alt="Pat Brown">
      <p> Pat Brown first studied dance with Jane Hart in Hartford, Connecticut, and then at the Hartford Conservatory. She was trained in the Cecchetti method of ballet but believes that an eclectic approach to teaching and learning is the most beneficial for her students. After moving to Jackson, TN. from Upstate New York she opened the Pat Brown School of Dancing&nbsp; in 1963.&nbsp; She has been Artistic Director of the local civic group Ballet Arts, Inc., since its beginning in 1972. Under her direction many master teachers and	famous dancers from various parts of the world and the United States have performed for Jackson audiences. In 1999 the Tennessee Association of Dance awarded Ms. Brown "Dance Teacher of the Year." </p><p>"Miss" Pat has taught&nbsp; and touched the lives of young people that have gone on to careers in dance, as dancers, actors, singers and dance teachers. She is&nbsp; proud of those that work in the business and professional world, are&nbsp; homemakers and are parents of new dancers.&nbsp; She enjoys the visits of her former students and likes to see the added generations in her classes.</p>

          <h1>Kim Turner</h1><img id="treehouse" src="img/teacher4.jpg" alt="Kim Turner">
 <p>Kim Turner has been part of the dance studio for 30 Years.  As a child she started classes at age 3 and continued through high school.  Her training with her mother, Pat Brown, prepared her to be an asset to the studio. After a brief absence she took over teaching in the satellite schools in Dyersburg, Corinth and Savannah.  When the enrollment in the Jackson studio increased, Kim concentrated on the acrobatic, preschool and hip hop programs at the Jackson studio.<br>
Kim's expertise in acrobatic/tumbling training is widely known to the mid south.  Her students come to her from surrounding areas.  She has trained dancers that have won places on University dance teams across Tennessee and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Kim brings a warmth and friendliness to the studio in her work with the "babies".  Her gentle but firm guidance with the young classes have helped develop many shy children into confident and budding ballerinas. Hip Hop classes taught by "Miss Kim" are popular with the dancers and Kim continues to educate herself by going to teacher conferences and training workshops.</p>
